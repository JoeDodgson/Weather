Description: A weather dashboard web page that allows the user to search for any city to see the current weather and a 5 day weather forecast. The page stores and displays the user's searched cities and the user can select any city from their search history. The web page calls the OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve weather data.

Installation: No installation required

Usage: To find the current weather and 5-day weather forecast for any city, type the city name into the 'search' field and click the search icon. You can click on any city from the past searches to bring up its current weather and 5-day forecast.
